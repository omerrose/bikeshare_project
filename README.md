# bikeshare_project
Explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

In this project, I used Python code to import US bike share data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.
I also used a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
